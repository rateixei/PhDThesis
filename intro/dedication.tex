\begin{dedication}
\noindent
\,\,\,\,\,\, To the ones that came beside me, \\
To all the lost at land and sea, \\
To the wanderers under the night sky, \\
And the dreamers who have lost their seed

\vspace{.5cm}

To the broken bones and ragged mind \\
Healing off in Amazonian delight \\
To the old ones that are here again \\
Looping over colored mandalas of zen

\vspace{.5cm}

To the tough chocolate bossa nova \\
From whom life takes me away over and over \\
To the latin blood in Mexican dressing \\
The harbinger of my astrological blessings

\vspace{.5cm}

To the lily of the valley that springs on the ice \\
Where airbags and whiskey can complete a life \\
And also to the ones of whom I think not often, \\
Some things are meant to be forgotten

\vspace{.5cm}

To the bumps and jumps and lumps \\
Of things I throw away or save for a rainy day \\
When I remember the ones that came beside me \\
I bow at this end, my friends, and I thank thee
