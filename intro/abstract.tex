The experimental discovery of the Higgs boson is one of the latest successes of the Standard Model of particle physics. 
Although all measurements have confirmed that this newly discovered particle is the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model, with no deviations to suggest otherwise, the Higgs boson can guide us to new models which modify the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism or predict new states that couple to the Higgs. 
Therefore, it's paramount to directly look for modifications of our current model with the help of the recently discovered particle. 
In this thesis, two analyses involving beyond the Standard Model physics tied to the Higgs sector will be explored. 
First, looking at exotic Higgs decays, an analysis searching for the final state with photons and missing transverse energy will be presented. 
Then, the search for Higgs pair production, both resonantly and non-resonantly (a process predicted by the Standard Model, albeit at very low rates), in the final state with two bottom quark jets and two photons will be detailed. 
An important part of these results is the performance of the Compact Muon Solenoid's Electromagnetic Calorimeter, which will also be presented.
