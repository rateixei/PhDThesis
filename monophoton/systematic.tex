\section{Systematic uncertainties}

The experimental systematic uncertainties considered in the analysis are listed in Table~\ref{tab:sys}. Since the model-independent and model-specific selections differ significantly, e.g. the inclusion of the mismeasured \met reduction selection and \etg window for the model specific results, the systematic uncertainties are evaluated separately for each selection. The systematic uncertainty associated with the measurement of the integrated luminosity is 2.6$\%$~\cite{CMS:2013gfa}. The photon energy scale uncertainty~\cite{2014photon} of about 1$\%$ affects the signal and background predictions by $4\%$ for the model specific selection and by $0.5\%$ for the model independent selection.  Similarly, the jet energy scale uncertainty affects the signal and background predictions by $2-5\%$ depending on the process and selection.  When varying the photon or jet energy scales, the \met is also recomputed. In addition, the systematic uncertainty associated with the jet energy resolution ($0.5\%$) and unclustered energy (energy not contained within jets or leptons or photons) scale ($2\%$) are propagated to the \met and effect the signal and background predictions by $2-4\%$. The uncertainty due to the choice of parton density functions (PDFs) is estimated following PDF4LHC recommendations~\cite{PDF4LHC,PDF4LHC1,MSTW08LO} and are found to be $10\%$ for SUSY Higgs boson signal, and $4\%$ for $Z\nu\nu\gamma$ and the $W\gamma$. An additional uncertainty due to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales is evaluated using MCFM and is found to be $3\%$ for $Z\nu\nu\gamma$ and the $W\gamma$. As described in the previous section, a $16\%$ uncertainty is applied to the $\gamma$+jet normalization due to the difference in the jet multiplicity distribution between the data and background prediction in the  $\gamma$+jet control region. The uncertainty due to the pileup modeling is found to be $1\%$ and is estimated by shifting the central value of the total inelastic cross section from 69.4 mb to 73.5 mb. Finally, the systematic uncertainties associated with backgrounds estimated from data have been applied as discussed in previous section. 

%    Table \ref{tab:sys} summarizes all the systematic uncertainties (in $\%$) estimated on $A\times\epsilon$ for Susy Higgs signal and all backgrounds. These uncertainties are used for limit setting procedure.
