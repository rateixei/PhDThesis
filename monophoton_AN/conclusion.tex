\section{Conclusions}

  A search for new physics in the $\gamma+$\met final state is performed using pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7.3\fbinv collected at $\sqrt{s}= 8$\TeV using low threshold triggers in a phase space region defined by \et$> 45$ GeV and \met$>40$ GeV. In the absence of any evidence of new physics, upper limits are placed on the production cross section of new physics in a model-independent way for different \met and $M_{T}$ thresholds. The data are also examined using optimized selections for maximum sensitivity to an exotic decay of the Higgs boson $h\to \PXXSG\PSGczDo,\PSGczDo\to\PXXSG\gamma$ predicted in a low-scale SUSY breaking scenario. Upper limits at 95$\%$ CL are placed on the new physics production cross section times the branching ratio, as well as the ratio of this product to the SM Higgs boson production cross section. The results are found to be compatible with the Standard Model hypothesis. These results are the first limits on this model from collider searches.
